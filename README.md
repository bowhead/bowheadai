# Chat With Your Health Data

This is a monorepo composed of:

- Front-end: Here users can upload their health related files, like lab results, medical reports or information generated by a wearable. Then they can "chat" with their data by asking questions to get more insights
- Back-end: The files uploaded by the user are processed and indexed so it is easier to create a vector used to finetune a large language model (LLM)

## UI

Located in the ui directory, it has all the needed code to run the front-end where the users interact with the app
